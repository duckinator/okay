# Okay

Okay provides implementations of common utilities in Ruby which aim to
prioritize the ability to understand the code, at the expense of being
less full-featured than more specialized alternatives.

Goals:

* Concise, but easy-to-understand code.
* Be reasonably robust, but don't chase every potential edgecase. Handle
  them as they come, and try to find a way to the code easy to
  understand.
* Well-documented codebase.
  * Document known limitations, not just features.
  * Document tests, not just the implementation.
* Thorough, easily-understood tests.

The choices of what utilities to implement and how to implement them is
inherently _extremely_ subjective, and prone to changing depending on
real-world use and feedback. Be sure to take a glance at the relevant code
or ask questions if you aren't sure it'll work for your usecase.

If it doesn't, I may decide I want to add support for it, or be able to
help you find something that works for you!

## Utilities

Currently implemented utilities:

* HTTP fetcher.
  * `GET` requests implemented.
  * `POST` requests implemented.
  * Other types of requests should be fairly easy to add, but haven't
    been added.
  * TLS is supported, using [`openssl/better_defaults`](https://github.com/duckinator/openssl-better_defaults/) to improve security on old Ruby versions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'okay'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install okay

## Usage

### HTTP

```ruby
require 'okay/http'

Okay::HTTP.get("https://smallest.dog") #=> #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>
Okay::HTTP.get("https://smallest.dog").body # => returns the page contents.
# TODO: document Okay::HTTP.post().
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
